## P.S

This project includes three main routes:
1.Authentication
2.Calendar
3.Choosen day shedule

Firebase was choosen for authentication with email and password. Firebase also provide users with real time database which was choosen for store user data. It is easy for implement and usage. It also provide another opportunities.

For styling was used styled-components module. I think it is the best and convinient way to style your react components.

In UI was used material-ui module. It let implement some animated or just beautiful ready to use componets to your app.

Project has self-made calendar with two locales(en, ru).
